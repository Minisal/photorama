<h4>About Me</h4>
A postgraduate student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University with my advisor Prof. Li Yang<a href="http://ihpdep.github.io/"></a>. In 2021, I completed my bachelor's degree at the School of Software, East China Normal University. In 2022, I was an intern at Nanhu Research Institute, researching deep learning algorithms for multi-view reconstruction based on the MVSNet series. In 2020, I was an intern at Tencent, working on the front end of WeChat mini-programs. In addition, I participate internship at Sumset in 2022 for Unity-based game developing.

<h4>Research Interest</h4>
My research interests are in the fields of computer vision and computer graphics, especially modeling scene information with neural implicit functions. I'm also very interested in special effects in game development, especially lighting and materials. Currently, my focus is on monocular 3D reconstruction/fusion and neural expression and rendering. In general, my research areas include:
<br>
Computer Graphics (Neural Rendering)
Computer Vision (3D Reconstruction)
Machine Learning
